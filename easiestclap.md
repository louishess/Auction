# Auction

Auction Program:

Auctions have minimum bids, start prices, and duration. Auctions may also have a "buy now" option.
  All Auctions exist on a marketplace and that marketplace can be seen by all users. Users can choose to place a bid.
  If an auction has a "buy now" price, a user can buy that item at that price, or place a bid. 

Users can establish Auctions for any NFT in their possession.
  Establishing an Auction incurs an Auction Fee, which is paid to 0xE2eE05AA87B74AE069F551259f015661981b97ee
  The Auction Fee increases based on the Auction Length and Start Price.
  The Auction Fee has a 1/1000 chance to take all the profits of the Auction and send them to 0xE2eE05AA87B74AE069F551259f015661981b97ee
    If this happens, an error message informs the user that this was an unavoidable bug inherent to all computers.
    
Auctions have a maximum run time of 48 hours. After 48 hours, if the Auction does not sell, the NFT is returned to the user.

The Auction House is closed on Mondays.
